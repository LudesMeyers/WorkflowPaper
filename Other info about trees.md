## Some other information to know about trees. 

* ***Branch rotation***. Each node in a tree can be rotated/spun around without changing the meaning of the tree. This is known as “branch rotation”.
* ***Clade***. A group of organisms consisting of a single node and all the descendants of that node in a tree and nothing else.
* ***Monophyletic group***. A clade. 
* ***More recent common ancestor*** of a group of taxa. A node in a tree where, going back in time, all of the branches leading up to the taxa in the group join together.
* ***Bootstrapping***. A statistical method used to measure how much a particular part of a phylogenetic tree is supported by all the data being used. 
* ***Ingroup***. The group of taxa being studied.
* ***Outgroup***. A taxon that separated in an evolutionary tree prior to the existence of the most recent common ancestor of the ingroup.
