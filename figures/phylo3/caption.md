(COMMENT FROM EISEN - IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE RATIO OF FONT:DEAD SPACE COULD BE IMPROVED IN THIS AND THE OTHER TREE FIGURES). Above is an example of a well constructed/informative tree. Our species (Brachybacterium muris UCD-AY4) falls within a clade where every named member has the same name "Brachybacterium muris", and this species name does not occur elsewhere on the tree.
