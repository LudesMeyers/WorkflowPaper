\label{fig:FIGURE_ID}
The left side of the figure shows an example of an informative phylogenetic tree. Our species of interest (_Brachybacterium muris_ UCD-AY4) falls within a clade where every named member has the same name "_Brachybacterium muris_", and this species name does not occur elsewhere on the tree. The bootstrap value of the Muris clade is high (0.926) indicating that this clade is well supported. _Pseudomonas stutzeri_ was chosen as the outgroup because it is phylogenetically distinct to _Brachybacterium_.

On the right side of the figure are the BLAST results for the 16s SSU rRNA of our species. As shown in the tree, the most similar species (highest identity scores and lowest E values) are _Brachybacterium muris_ or unspecified _Brachybacterium_ species.
