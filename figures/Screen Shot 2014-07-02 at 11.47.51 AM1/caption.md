Figure 7-The left side of the figure shows an example of a well constructed/informative tree. Our species (Brachybacterium muris UCD-AY4) falls within a clade where every named member has the same name "Brachybacterium muris", and this species name does not occur elsewhere on the tree (other members of the clade have the no species designation-represented by sp). The bootstrap value of the Muris clade is high (0.926) indicating that this clade is well supported by the data. Pseudomonas stutzeri was chosen as the outgroup because it is phylogenetically distinct in comparison with Brachybacterium.

On the right side of the figure are the BLAST results for the 16s SSU rRNA of our species. As shown in the tree, the most similar species (highest identity scores and lowest E values) are Brachybacterium muris or sp.
