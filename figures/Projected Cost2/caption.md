This figure shows the estimated materials (i.e. without labor) cost of performing a genome sequencing project with this workflow.  The "Best Case" shows the marginal cost of sequencing one genome in a case where you are multiplexing 48 samples, and have the appropriate kits and reagents on hand.   The "Worst Case" shows the cost of doing a single genome, with no multiplexing, in a lab where every reagent needed to be purchased new and was not used for anything else.  Specific assumptions are as follows;  
<sup>1</sup>
This assumes the purchase of a standard DNA extraction kit, good for 100 samples.
<sup>2</sup>This assumes purchase of a standard 200U PCR reagent kit.  
<sup>3</sup>PCR cleanup can be performed in a number of ways; gel extraction, beads, or columns for example.  Here we assume purchase of a standard column-based kit.  
<sup>4</sup>Sanger sequencing cost is given as the price per reaction ($7 at our sequencing facility), times the forward and reverse reactions.  
<sup>5</sup>This assumes the purchase of a 48-sample Nextera or TrueSeq kit from Illumina, however kits from other manufacterers can be cheaper.  
<sup>6</sup>Our sequencing cost estimate assumes to purchase of an Illumina MiSeq run from a sequencing facility.
