#General notes on bacterial systematics.
In order to identify to which organism a 16S rDNA sequence belongs, as well as to provide an evolutionary context for your organism of interest, we recommend building a phylogenetic tree (see Section X). Here we will briefly discuss a few terms that will make interpretation of the phylogenetic tree a simple task. Interpreting a phylogenetic tree is much like navigating in a Terminal window, in that you can probably get by with a few basic concepts, but you will need to invest some time in learning them

##Node
This is where
##Bootstrap support
This is a number, usually expressed on a scale of 0-100, but occasionally on a scale of 0-1, that provides an estimate of the confidence in a node.
##Monophyly
##Outgroup
