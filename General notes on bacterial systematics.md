#General notes on bacterial systematics.
In order to identify to which organism a 16S rDNA sequence belongs, as well as to provide an evolutionary context for your organism of interest, we recommend building a phylogenetic tree (see Section X). Building the phylogenetic tree is the easy part. Intelligent interpretation of the tree will require an investment of time, similar to the investment required to learn the basics of UNIX. Fortunately, there are a number of resources available for this purpose. We recommend this online tutorial (http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/phylogenetics_02) or this very nice paper by Baldauf

As with UNIX, we will list some basic terms with which you should make yourself familiar before attempting to make sense of your tree.

##Branch
All of the organisms in a tree are at the tips of brances (that's why they are sometimes referred to as leaves.) All of the branches show the way in which organisms are connected (related) to each other.
##Node
These are the points where branches connect.
##Clade
A clade is a group of organism that 
##Bootstrap support
This is a number, usually expressed on a scale of 0-100, but occasionally on a scale of 0-1, that provides an estimate of the confidence in a node.
##Monophyly
##Outgroup
##Rooting
